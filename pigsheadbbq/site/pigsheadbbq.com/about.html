      <h1>Built on Smoke, Fire, and Time</h1>
      <p>
        James Sluss has spent nearly 20 years in the restaurant world. He trained at GRCC in Grand Rapids, served on the
        U.S. Culinary Team, and worked his way through kitchens across Michigan. But long before the titles and the
        kitchens, he was the guy running the family grill.
      </p>
      <p>Barbecue stuck with him.</p>
      <p>
        After tasting pulled pork that stopped him in his tracks while working under a talented pit-minded chef, he dove
        in headfirst. Regional styles, spice blends, smoke profiles — nothing was off limits. It wasn't a hobby. It was a
        pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, James built his first smoker out of a 1950s Philco refrigerator. No shortcuts. No gimmicks. Just steel,
        fire, and patience. That's where Pigs Head BBQ really started.
      </p>
      <p>He fed friends. Then friends of friends. Then crowds.</p>
      <p>
        By 2017, with some encouragement from his wife Michelle, he set up roadside in Gobles and never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Today, we serve Michigan craft barbecue the way it's meant to be.</p>
      <p>17-hour Texas-style brisket. Dry-rubbed St. Louis ribs. Smoky beans loaded with 16-hour pulled pork.</p>
      <p>
        We don't drown our meat in sauce. We serve it on the side — because good bark, clean smoke, and real seasoning
        don't need hiding.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when you want sauce, we've got six of them — all made in-house, in small batches. Alabama white.
        Sweet-and-spicy Carolina vinegar. A golden honey favorite. Each one built to lift the meat, not cover it.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>From a fridge smoker to a full operation, one thing hasn't changed: We show up early. We cook it slow. We do it right.</p>
      <p class="outro">We are family. We are small-batch American BBQ.</p>
